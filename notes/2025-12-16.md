- Loaded PaySim dataset and explored transaction types and fraud rates.
- Set up .gitignore to avoid committing large CSV files.
- Explored PaySim synthetic dataset (6.36M rows, 11 columns).
- Found overall fraud rate ≈ 0.129% and fraud only in CASH_OUT and TRANSFER types.
- Noted implications for AML training: focus on outgoing flows for synthetic scenarios.

- Next: build the first baseline fraud model on PaySim.
